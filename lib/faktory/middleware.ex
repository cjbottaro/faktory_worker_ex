defmodule Faktory.Middleware do
  @moduledoc ~S"""
  Middleware behaviour for client (enqueing) and worker (dequeing/processing).

  On the client side, a middleware chain alters a job before it is enqueued.

  On the worker side, a middleware chain alters a job before it is processed.

  It's just a simple behaviour that requires `call/2`. Almost no reason to
  even make it a behaviour other than having a module to attach documentation to.

  Let's make worker middleware that logs how long jobs take to process.

  ```elixir
  defmodule JobTimer do
    use Faktory.Middleware
    import Faktory.Utils, only: [now_in_ms: 0]
    alias Faktory.Logger

    def call(job, f) do
      # Alter the job by putting a start time in the custom field.
      job = job
        |> Map.put_new("custom", %{})
        |> put_in(["custom", "start_time"], now_in_ms())

      # Pass it along to get processed.
      job = f.(job)

      # Calculate the elapse time.
      elapsed = now_in_ms() - job["custom"]["start_time"]
      elapsed = (elapsed / 1000) |> Float.round(3)
      jid = job["jid"]

      Logger.info("Job #{jid} took #{elapsed} seconds!")

      # Always return the job for other middlewares further up the chain.
      job
    end
  end
  ```

  Next add it to the worker configuration.

  ```elixir
  config :faktory_worker_ex,
    worker: [
      middleware: [JobTimer]
    ]
  ```

  Super contrived because we don't actually need to alter the job to time it.
  It's just meant to illustrate the idea of altering a job in a way that other
  middlewares further up or down the chain can see the change.

  It is important to capture the changes to the job after passing it along:
  ```elixir
    job = f.(job)
  ```
  That way you can see any changes made after handing it off and it comes
  back down the chain after being processed.

  Invoke the middleware.

  The function invokes the next middleware in the chain. You can modify the job
  both before and after invoking the function. The function may return a
  modified job. `call/2` must return a job.

  Example middleware that does nothing:
  ```elixir
    def call(job, f) do
      f.(job)
    end
  ```

      job, [middleware | chain], next ->
        monad = fn job -> next.(job, chain, next) end
        middleware.call(job, monad)
